This project is the implementation of our proposed scheme of receiver positioning and beam steering. With the hardware design models and the source code, you can replicate the findings in our paper and explore new ideas and schemes based on the current design. If you require any further information or if we can be of any assistance, feel free to contact us by creating an [issue](https://github.com/WPT-Lab124/Receiver-Positioning-and-Beam-Steering/issues) or send us emails.

## Preparation
- To get started, you need to have two stepper motors, two motor controllers, Raspberry Pi 4B with Camera module v2 (or other computers and cameras, but the code needs modification), an infrared filter, an infrared laser (e.g., 100 mW, 808nm), and two laser mirrors.
- Manufacture the 3D-printing models and the PCB, and assemble everything.
- Setup the python environment on Raspberry Pi. See [Ref](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzVYnG-WaM4&t=2s).
- Download the code on your Raspberry Pi.
- Test the system performance with `main.py`, `protocol_1.py`, or `protocol_2.py`.

A photo of the implementation is shown in the following image. The photovoltaic (PV) cell is manufactured by our collaborators, but you can use the receiver without PV cells because it has negligible influence on the intensity of the laser spot beamed at the receiver.

## Experimental Videos
### Protocol 1
***With 16 microstepping***

Parameters: the distance between the transmitter and the receiver is 2 m; the initial distance between the receiver and the laser spot is 10 cm.

***With 256 microstepping***
